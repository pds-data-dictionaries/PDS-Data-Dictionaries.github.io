Build LDD Using Github
++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, as long as your Discipline LDD is using the `ldd-template repository <https://github.com/pds-data-dictionaries/ldd-template/>`_, all Discipline LDD schemas, schematrons, and other default LDDTool outputs are generated whenever a Pull Request is created with a change to an IngestLDD.

The new schemas/schematrons are posted to the `build/development` directory in your repository. See :doc:`LDD Update and Build Tutorial </support/tutorials>` for an example generating these schemas/schematrons.


For more details on how the dictionaries are generated, see `LDD Github Actions`.
