Proposing a New Discipline LDD
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Creation of a new Discipline LDDs should be discussed and approved by the PDS LDD Change Control Board (TBD Email list or google group). During this process the following must be determined:

1. Is this LDD needed?
----------------------

Does a similar dictionary exist? If so, what is the rationale for creating a new one instead of adding to an existing one?


2. Who is the LDD Stewardship Team?
------------------------------------

* Responsible for design, implementation, and review LDD development.
* Membership includes **one lead LDD steward** and one or more stakeholders who are identified either by the lead LDD steward and/or dLDD Approval Board.


3. Who is the dLDD Modeling Team?
---------------------------------

* Responsible for reviewing and approving changes to the dLDDs to be released.
* Membership includes one or more PDS Engineering Node data engineers who have in depth experience in information modeling and ontology.


----

Proposing a New Mission LDD
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Contact your Discipline Node to help you along this process. Many of the best practices and review rigor described below may not be necessary for Mission LDD development.

----

Submit Request For New LDD Creation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Upon receiving approval to begin development on your new LDD, it must be initialized by reserving a namespace ID and creating a new repo.

Create a new ``[ldd-request] Initialize New PDS LDD`` issue within the `PDSEN Operations repo <https://github.com/NASA-PDS/pdsen-operations/issues/new/choose>`_ and fill out the issue template with the applicable information.

Part of the initialization procedure will include a new namespace added to the PDS4 Information Model and `PDS4 Namespace Registry <https://pds.nasa.gov/datastandards/schema/pds-namespace-registry.pdf>`_ and a new repo will be created.

The EN Operations Team will notify you once the repo is ready to use.

Initializing New LDD
++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::
    Responsible Party: Member of `PDSEN Operations <https://github.com/orgs/pds-data-dictionaries/teams/pdsen-operations/members>`_

.. note::
    This can probably be scripted someday using GithubAPI or within a Github Action.

1. Create ``PDS Namespace Request`` issue in `PDS4 Information Model repo <https://github.com/NASA-PDS/pds4-information-model/issues/new/choose>`_ with info from and reference to the ticket in PDSEN Operations repo.

2. Once namespace request has been completed, :ref:`Create LDD Stewardship Team`.

3. Once team has been created, :ref:`Creating New LDD Repository`

Create LDD Stewardship Team
---------------------------

Create a new team `here <https://github.com/orgs/pds-data-dictionaries/new-team>`_ :

* **Team name:** ``[namespace_id] LDD Stewardship Team``
* **Team visibility:** ``Visible``

Add the users noted in the LDD Initialization Ticket.

Next step: :ref:`Creating New LDD Repository`


Creating New LDD Repository

Once the namespace request has been completed. We can create the repo from the ldd-template


**Create new repo from ldd-template**

a. `Create new repo <https://github.com/pds-data-dictionaries/ldd-template/generate>`_

b. Set the following parameters:
    * ``Owner``: ``pds-data-dictionaries``
    * ``Repository Name``: should follow the naming scheme ``ldd-<namespace_id>``.
    * ``Description``: enter description sent by LDD Steward
    * Set visibility to ``Public``


**Update Repo Settings**

We need to setup the teams and ``main`` branch protections.

a. Go to ``Settings``

b. Disable issues being created on this repo (they will be created in the PDS4 LDD Issue Repo).

c. Add appropriate teams with access to repo
    * Go to ``Manage Access``
    * Click on ``Invite teams or people``
    * Add the ``<namespace_id> LDD Stewardship Team`` with Admin access
    * Add the ``@pdsen-operations-team`` with Admin access
    * If this is a Discipline LDD Repo, add the ``@dldd-data-modeling-team`` with Write access

d. Set branches protections
    * Go to ``Branches``
    * Under **Branch protection rules**, click ``Add rule``
    * Enter **Branch name pattern:** ``main``
    * Select ``Require pull request reviews before merging``
    * Select ``Require review from Code Owners``
    * Select ``Require status checks to pass before merging``
       * Search and select the ``Tag and Release LDD (x.x.x.x)`` action.
    * Select ``Restrict who can push to matching branches``

e. Set GitHub Pages Deployment
    * Go to ``Settings`` -> ``Pages``
    * Under ``Build and Deployment`` -> ``Source``, select ``GitHub Actions``

**Create new issue template in PDS4 LDD Issue Repo**

a. `Create a new label <https://github.com/pds-data-dictionaries/PDS4-LDD-Issue-Repo/labels>`_ in the PDS4 LDD Issue Repo for the new repo (ldd-<namespace_id>)

b. Clone the `PDS4 LDD Issue Repo <https://github.com/pds-data-dictionaries/PDS4-LDD-Issue-Repo/>`_

c. Execute the `generate-issue-template.sh bash script <https://github.com/pds-data-dictionaries/PDS4-LDD-Issue-Repo/blob/main/bin/generate-issue-template.sh>`_. This will automatically generate an issue template from the `LDD Issue Template <https://github.com/pds-data-dictionaries/PDS4-LDD-Issue-Repo/blob/main/templates/ldd-issue-template.md>`_ and push to the repo::

        $ bin/generate-issue-template.sh <namespace_id> '<namespace_name>' <ldd_steward_username>
        New issue template created: /Users/jpadams/Documents/proj/pds/pdsen/workspace/pds4-ldd-issue-repo/bin/../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/-ldd-cart--ldd-update-request.md
        [main 950bedb] Add cart issue template

        To github.com:pds-data-dictionaries/pds4-ldd-issue-repo.git
           b0abee5..950bedb  main -> main

d. You should now see a `new issue template created <https://github.com/pds-data-dictionaries/PDS4-LDD-Issue-Repo/issues/new/choose>`_


**Notify LDD Stewardship Team**

Notify the LDD Stewardship Team the new repo is ready in the PDSEN Operations issue, e.g.:

..

    @<stewardship_team_member_0>, @<stewardship_team_member_1>, and @<stewardship_team_member_n> your LDD repo is now ready for use at https://github.com/pds-data-dictionaries/ldd-<namespace_id>. Read through `Getting to Know Your LDD Repo <https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io/getting-started.html#getting-to-know-your-ldd-repo>`_ to get started.

----

Retrofit Existing LDD Repository (Admin / Stewards Only)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Clone the ldd-template repo and the LDD repo to be retrofitted. For this example, we will be retrofitting the ``ldd-img`` repo::

    git clone git@github.com:pds-data-dictionaries/ldd-template.git
    git clone git@github.com:pds-data-dictionaries/ldd-img.git

2. From the ``ldd-img`` repo, rsync the various files from the ``ldd-template`` repo::

    cd ldd-img
    rsync -av ../ldd-template/.gitignore ../ldd-template/.github ../ldd-template/build ../ldd-template/src ../ldd-template/test ./

3. Rename or remove test files and example IngestLDD so they don't get picked up in the regression tests (files can't end in .xml)::

    mv test/test1_FAIL.xml test/test1_FAIL.xml_example
    mv test/test1_VALID.xml test/test1_VALID.xml_example
    rm src/PDS4_EXAMPLE_IngestLDD.xml

4. Re-arrange directories to match that of the ``ldd-template`` repo. Specifically note the ``build/development`` and ``build/release`` directories.

5. Create a branch and pull request, and verify the Github Action executes successfully. e.g. https://github.com/pds-data-dictionaries/ldd-img/actions/

6. Remove local repo github issues, update permissions on the repository, and add branch protections per :doc:`Update Repo Settings above <ldd-create#update-repo-settings>`

7. Update README as appropriate to direct people to Contribute and Get Support. See the `ldd-template README <https://github.com/pds-data-dictionaries/ldd-template/blob/main/README.md>`_ for more details.
