Proposing a New Mission LDD
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For PDS users, contact your Discipline Node to help you along this process. Many of the best practices and review rigor described below may not be necessary for Mission LDD development.

For Discipline Node staff, once a mission LDD has been decided upon, follow the process to `Submit Request For New LDD Creation <ldd-create.html#submit-request-for-new-ldd-creation>`_

Release a Mission LDD
+++++++++++++++++++++

Unlike the `Discipline LDD Nominal Release Process <ldd-release.html#nominal-development-and-release>`_, Mission LDDs require the LDD Steward to:

1. `Manually Prepare a Release in GitHub <ldd-release.html#preparing-a-release>`_
2. `Manually Submit a Release Request to the EN Operations Team through GitHub <ldd-release.html#submit-release-request>`_
